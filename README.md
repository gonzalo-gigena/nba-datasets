# NBA Datasets
Welcome to the **NBA Datasets** repository! This project aims to provide comprehensive datasets related to the National Basketball Association (NBA) sourced from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).

## Project Status
⚠️ Early Stages: This project is currently in the early stages of development. The datasets provided are limited, but i'm actively working on incorporating play-by-play stats and shot charts data.

## Data Collection
The datasets have been collected using a custom API designed specifically for scraping basketball-related data from basketball-reference.com. This API will be published as a separate project once it's finished. We are committed to ensuring that the scraping process is respectful of the website's terms of service.
